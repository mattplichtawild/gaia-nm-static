I have several things I want to add or change. First is to get donations set up, the payment processor I'll use will have the ability to do subscriptions. I also need to change the way pictures are displayed on animal pages.

All the pages need to be updated to what you want! The hero images on each page and the page content itself. Those are things you can do using the editor. Any style changes, or big changes involving new components, just let me know and I can add them to the list!

If you click on that green pencil icon in the left corner you'll be able to add new animals, blog posts, and pages. It's a neat tool, but I didn't realize how many bugs it would have. I'm going to use a different CMS in production anyway since the site will need user authentication so you can login to edit pages, add animals, or add a blog post.

In addition to a donation page that can take credit cards, I can also display your venmo QR code. My goal is to make this something you can add as a component to any page like if you want to do a special campaign. 

Eventually I want to build a component that displays a feed of your instagram posts, I might even be able to make one that can tracks posts of animals by name and shows a feed at the bottom of the animal's page.

I hope you like it!
