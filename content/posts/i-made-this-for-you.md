When you asked if I could help, I had already been thinking of ways I could support you. We had the same vision, at least for this one way I could help. I wonder what other visions we share.

If you click on that green pencil icon in the left corner you'll be able to add new animals, blog posts, and pages. It's a neat tool, but I didn't realize how many bugs it would have. I'm going to use a different CMS in production anyway since the site will need user authentication so you can login to edit pages, add animals, or add a blog post.

Next thing on my list to build is a donation page that can take credit cards, I can also display your venmo qr code. The payment processor I'll use will have the ability to do subscriptions.
