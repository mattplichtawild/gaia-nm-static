When you asked if I could help, I had already been thinking of ways I could support you. We had the same vision, at least for this one way I could help. I wonder what other visions we share.

I see ways our journeys can intertwine, each of us growing from it. You have quite a life force about you, Cierra, it radiates!

I made this because it helps you help the animals you are saving, and it does help my foray into webdev and software. The motivation was all you, I want to be part of your story.

I want to see our connection grow :)
